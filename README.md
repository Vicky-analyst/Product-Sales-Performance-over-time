## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data to understand revenue distribution across different counties and products. The focus is on identifying the highest and lowest-performing counties, comparing their contributions to total sales, and examining the factors driving these differences. Population density, urbanization, and the presence of entertainment venues play a crucial role in sales performance, with urbanized counties contributing significantly more revenue.

Additionally, the project explores product-level sales trends, identifying the best-selling products and those with seasonal demand fluctuations. While some products maintain steady sales throughout the year, others experience sharp increases during specific periods, such as holidays. Understanding these patterns provides valuable insights into consumer purchasing behavior and market trends.

By leveraging data analysis and visualization, this project offers a comprehensive view of how sales are distributed across locations and product categories, helping businesses and stakeholders make informed decisions.

### Data Cleaning

I converted data types to ensure consistency. I thoroughly cleaned the store name column by removing attached addresses, numbers, and excess spaces. I removed unnecessary columns to reduce redundancy. To validate data quality and identify errors, I conducted checks for data validity. I also performed exploratory data analysis to examine distinct values and detect null values, confirming that the dataset was error-free and had no missing data.

### Data Modelling
The dataset is structured as a standalone table without relational connections to other tables, meaning it does not follow a star or snowflake schema. However, it is linked to the date table for time-based analysis.

### Data Analysis And Insight

- American vodkas consistently generate the highest monthly revenue, exceeding $3.5 million and accounting for 13.7% of total sales across 54 products. They also maintain a strong monthly demand of 14%. In contrast, cocktails and imported vodkas rank as the lowest-performing products, with a significantly lower demand of just 0.0005%. However, while top-selling products maintain steady demand year-round, certain products, such as temporary specials and cream liqours, experience a significant surge in sales during the holiday season.

   #### The key factors driving Top 10 high sales include:
   **Population Density & Urbanization** -> The top 10 highest-selling counties are primarily urbanized, featuring more entertainment venues, restaurants, and nightlife hotspots. Cities like Des Moines, Davenport, and Cedar Rapids see increased alcohol demand due to their vibrant social scenes.

  ![](urban_cause.png)
  
   **Demographics & Store Distribution** –> A higher population density leads to more liquor stores being strategically located across the county, further driving overall sales.
- Hy-Vee Food Store generates the highest revenue, exceeding $3.6 million monthly, and accounts for 13.04% of total sales among the top 10 performing stores. this Top 10 store are located in county with great population density & urbanization like Plok, Scott, Linn etc, They also have on Avg 27000 Per Capita Income . thus explains why they are the top performing stores compared to stores least performing located in the rural county areas like Adams, Fremont and Davis

## Recommendation

- **Ensure Consistent Supply of High-Demand Products**
   Since American vodkas contribute the highest sales, maintaining stable inventory levels will prevent stockouts and meet customer demand. Temporary specials and cream       liquors should also be well-stocked during holiday periods to capitalize on seasonal spikes.

- **Strengthen Sales in Low-Performing Counties**
   Sales in counties like Fremont and Davis are significantly lower. Conducting targeted promotions, adjusting product selection, or improving store accessibility in these     areas could help increase sales.

- **Leverage Urban Market Growth**
   Polk County leads in sales due to its urbanization and high number of entertainment venues. Expanding distribution in similar high-density areas could further boost revenue.

- **Optimize Inventory and Marketing for Seasonal Trends**
   Sales increase during the fourth quarter, especially in December. Planning inventory and marketing campaigns around this trend can maximize revenue during peak periods.

- **Improve Store Placement for Higher Visibility**
   Sales data suggests that areas with more liquor stores generate higher revenue. Strategically placing new stores in high-traffic locations can further drive sales.

- **Use Data to Refine Sales Strategies**
   Regularly analyzing sales trends by product, county, and season can help optimize pricing, stock levels, and promotional efforts, ensuring a data-driven approach to    increasing revenue.
